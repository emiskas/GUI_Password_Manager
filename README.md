GUI Password Manager
===
This is a simple desktop application that allows you to securely manage your account credentials for various services. 

Built with Python, the app utilizes **PyQt5** for the graphical user interface (GUI), **pycryptodome** for cryptographic operations, and **cryptography** for encryption. The application stores data in a PostgreSQL database hosted on **Supabase**, allowing users to access their credentials from any computer using their master login credentials (email/password).

Installing and setting up
===
### 1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/emiskas/GUI_Password_Manager.git
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment in /GUI_Password_Manager/:
```
$ python3.12 -m venv .venv
```

### 3. Activate the virtual environment:

- #### For Linux / Mac:
```
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

- #### For Windows:
```
$ .\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 4. Install the required packages:
```
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Running the Application
===
 To start the application, you simply run the main_window.py file inside /GUI_Password_Manager/gui/. After that, you may register an account and start using the application.

Software dependencies

### PyQt5
PyQt5 is a set of Python bindings for the Qt application framework. It provides tools to create rich graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and desktop applications. With a range of widgets and a powerful event-driven programming model, PyQt5 offers a robust solution for building cross-platform applications with ease.

### pycryptodome
pycryptodome is a self-contained Python package for cryptographic operations. It includes both high-level cryptographic algorithms (like AES, RSA) and low-level primitives. Ideal for secure encryption, decryption, hashing, and random number generation, pycryptodome is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the older PyCrypto library, providing improved security and performance.

### cryptography
cryptography is a package designed to provide both high-level recipes and low-level cryptographic primitives to Python developers. Itâ€™s focused on offering a robust, secure, and easy-to-use API for a variety of cryptographic tasks, including key generation, encryption, and hashing. cryptography is regularly updated to meet the latest standards and security practices in the field.
